	<h1> HISTORY</h1>
        
	<h3 style= "margin-left:2.5em">The <b>history of agriculture</b> began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently <b>cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world</b>. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture.The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into <b>foods, fibers, fuels and raw materials (such as rubber)</b>.</h3>

	<h1> IMPORTANCE</h1>
	
	<h3 style= "margin-left:2.5em"> Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy. Over 70 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture. Agriculture is an important sector of Indian economy as it <b>contributes about 17% to the total GDP and provides employment to over 60% of the population.</b> 
        <br/>
<b>It's the source of our food supply.</b> Arguably the most important aspect of agriculture is that it's the source of the world's food supply. No matter where or what you are eating, the ingredients in your meals came from somewhere. All roads lead to agriculture.</h3>
